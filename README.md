# Trakk
Team management ASP.NET MVC application. 

Trakk is a dissertation piece in development for the final year of BSc Computer Science at The University of Hull. Trakk consists of a RESTful API providing data access to a second MVC application that manages View distribution. Trakk aims to provide an intuituive and friction-free interface to aid the mismanagement of many of the University's sports teams with.
The choice for an API was necessary as the project is expected to be integrated into the Athletics Union upon completion, if support for the Trakk frontend is no longer available the data layer remains and can be accessed by inhouse developers on campus for integration into their own solutions.
